# Star Match

## Description
This is a simple maths skills in-browser game made with React. When the game starts, the player gets a random number of stars between 1-9 and a fixed set of buttons numbered 1-9. The goal is to use all 9 numbers. For each random number of stars, the player needs to pick one or more numbers that sum to the number of stars. The game will always draw a number of stars that is playable. The player has 10 seconds to complete the game. If the timer runs out before all numbers are used, the game is over. Otherwise, the player wins.

### Installing

To play the game, make sure that NodeJS is installed on your machine, then run `npm install` inside of your project directory to install the project dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the game locally on port 3000.
